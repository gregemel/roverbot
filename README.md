# roverbot
2 motor arduino uno rover bot with L298 h-bridge and HC-SR04 ultra sonic range finder

verion 0.0.1 moves forward until the ping sensor indicates a blocking object is within 15cm, then stops.  When the object is more than 30cm, the bot goes forward again.  This version uses a simple finite state machine.

This project uses open hardware, open software, and open minds. My intention is to provide all code and designs for free (as in speech), with no warranty of any kind.
